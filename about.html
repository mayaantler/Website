    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
        <p>My name is Maya and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Victoria!</p><p>
            I am originally from the Okanagan region of British Columbia, but moved to Victoria in 2021 to obtain my bachelor's degree.
            Since then, I have spent most of my time taking a variety of courses, and exploring my passion for technology.
            
    </p>
            <p>Now that I am nearing the end of my degree, I am now looking to gain some relevant work experience in my field. 
                I have spent many years honing my skills, and now feel ready to apply my skills to have a real world impact.
